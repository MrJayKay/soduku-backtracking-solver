Soduku solver using python.

In this python project I use backtracking and recursion to solve a simple soduku grid. 

input numbers from soduku puzzle using 0 as blank spaces.

things I would like to add or improve:

- I would like to build a graphical interface to show the working of the backtracking algo.
